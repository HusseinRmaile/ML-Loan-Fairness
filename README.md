# HMDA 2018 Loan Approval Analysis

This repository contains our midterm project for Spring 2025, analyzing loan approval decisions using the 2018 HMDA dataset. Our work focuses on **data preprocessing, logistic regression modeling, and fairness-aware machine learning** to evaluate biases in lending decisions.

Note: This is a copy of the original from my Georgia Tech github enterprise account. It is copied over for archival purposes, none of the code base has been changed and the commit history is preserved. Specific contributions are also listed on report pages, as much of the collaboration was done on google drive. The interactive report viewer can be accessed in browser through github pages at [https://husseinrmaile.github.io/ML-Loan-Fairness/index.html](https://husseinrmaile.github.io/ML-Loan-Fairness/index.html).

### **Final Report**
- **`/final checkpoint images/`** – Directory that contains all the images used in the final report.
- **`ML spring 2025 plan.xlsx`** – Final Gantt Chart, excel version.

### **Midterm Report**
- **`/midterm images/`** – Directory that contains all the images used in the midterm report.

### **Initial Report**
- **`ML spring 2025 plan.pdf/png`** – Initial project planning document, including Gantt chart and milestones.

### **Web-Based Report Viewer**
The HTML files in this repository serve as an **interactive report viewer**, allowing users to navigate between different reports using JavaScript-powered buttons.

- **`final.html`** – Final report webpage.
- **`midterm.html`** – Midterm report webpage.
- **`styles.css`** – Stylesheet for report formatting.
- **`script.js`** – JavaScript to enable navigation between different report sections.
- **`index.html`** – Main landing page for initial project report

## **Usage**
To view the midterm report interactively:
1. Open **`index.html`** in a web browser.
2. Use the **navigation buttons** to switch between different sections of the report.

## **Acknowledgments**
This project was completed as part of our **Machine Learning course in Spring 2025**, leveraging the **HMDA 2018 dataset** for fairness-aware predictive modeling.
