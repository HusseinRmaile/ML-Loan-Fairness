# HMDA 2018 Loan Approval Analysis

This repository contains our midterm project for Spring 2025, analyzing loan approval decisions using the 2018 HMDA dataset. Our work focuses on **data preprocessing, logistic regression modeling, and fairness-aware machine learning** to evaluate biases in lending decisions.

## Repository Structure

### **Notebooks**
- **`HMDA_2018_preprocessing.ipynb`** – Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, dimensionality reduction, and standardization.
- **`Logistic_Regression.ipynb`** – Implementation of the logistic regression model, performance evaluation, and fairness analysis.
- **`hmda_naive_bayes.ipynb`** – Implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier, performance evaluation, and fairness analysis.
- **`hmda_SGD.ipynb`** – Implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier, performance evaluation, and fairness analysis.

### **Final Report**
- **`/final checkpoint images/`** – Directory that contains all the images used in the final report.
- **`ML spring 2025 plan.xlsx`** – Final Gantt Chart, excel version.

### **Midterm Report**
- **`/midterm images/`** – Directory that contains all the images used in the midterm report.

### **Initial Report**
- **`ML spring 2025 plan.pdf/png`** – Initial project planning document, including Gantt chart and milestones.

### **Web-Based Report Viewer**
The HTML files in this repository serve as an **interactive report viewer**, allowing users to navigate between different reports using JavaScript-powered buttons.

- **`final.html`** – Final report webpage.
- **`midterm.html`** – Midterm report webpage.
- **`styles.css`** – Stylesheet for report formatting.
- **`script.js`** – JavaScript to enable navigation between different report sections.
- **`index.html`** – Main landing page for initial project report

## **Usage**
To view the midterm report interactively:
1. Open **`index.html`** in a web browser.
2. Use the **navigation buttons** to switch between different sections of the report.

## **Acknowledgments**
This project was completed as part of our **Machine Learning course in Spring 2025**, leveraging the **HMDA 2018 dataset** for fairness-aware predictive modeling.
