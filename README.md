HMDA 2018 Loan Approval Analysis
This repository contains our midterm project for Spring 2025, analyzing loan approval decisions using the 2018 HMDA dataset. Our work focuses on data preprocessing, logistic regression modeling, and fairness-aware machine learning to evaluate biases in lending decisions.

Repository Structure
Notebooks
/ML_Project/HMDA_2018_preprocessing.ipynb: Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, dimensionality reduction, and standardization.

/ML_Project/Logistic_Regression.ipynb: Implementation of the logistic regression model, performance evaluation, and fairness analysis.
