# HMDA 2018 Loan Approval Analysis

This repository contains our midterm project for Spring 2025, analyzing loan approval decisions using the 2018 HMDA dataset. Our work focuses on **data preprocessing, logistic regression modeling, and fairness-aware machine learning** to evaluate biases in lending decisions.

## Repository Structure

### **Notebooks**
- **`HMDA_2018_preprocessing.ipynb`** – Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, dimensionality reduction, and standardization.
- **`Logistic_Regression.ipynb`** – Implementation of the logistic regression model, performance evaluation, and fairness analysis.

### **Midterm Report**
- **`ML_spring_2025_midterm_checkpoint_plan.pdf/png`** – Gantt Chart for Midterm.
- **`ML_spring_2025_plan.pdf/png/xlsx`** – Initial project planning documents, including Gantt chart and milestones.

### **Web-Based Report Viewer**
The HTML files in this repository serve as an **interactive report viewer**, allowing users to navigate between different reports using JavaScript-powered buttons.

- **`index.html`** – Main landing page for the project report.
- **`midterm.html`** – Midterm report in an interactive format.
- **`styles.css`** – Stylesheet for report formatting.
- **`script.js`** – JavaScript to enable navigation between different report sections.

## **Usage**
To view the midterm report interactively:
1. Open **`index.html`** in a web browser.
2. Use the **navigation buttons** to switch between different sections of the report.

## **Acknowledgments**
This project was completed as part of our **Machine Learning course in Spring 2025**, leveraging the **HMDA 2018 dataset** for fairness-aware predictive modeling.
